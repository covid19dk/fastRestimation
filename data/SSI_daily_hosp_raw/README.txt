daily hospitalizations manually scraped with webplotdigitizer from

day zero is 1. of march 2020

some sensible rounding is needed

absence of data from e.g. 2nd means plot has no bar on that day and no one was recorded hospitalized.
Every timeseries has recoreded all days until (excluding) day of time series.
