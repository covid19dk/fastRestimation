# fastRestimation
code project to try estimate R "reproduction rate" 2-8 day earlier than SSI

data report from 16th april to 7th of May is semi-manual extracted from SSI reports and +/- 1 error reads may occour
date from 8th May and onward is acquired from SSI available zip files

from and including 14th of May, SSI has updated their reporting system of admissions. It seems the reporting lag has been improved.
